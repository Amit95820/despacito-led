blinking led

this is the project which shows how led blinks on songs.
first of all u need to remember these points.

  1.You should have an arduino, any board type- no restrictions
  
  2.leds of 3 colors.
  
  3.breadboard.
  
  4.jumper wires- mostly male to male.
  
  5.resistors(not necessary, its as per ur wish)
  
  6.Arduino IDE.
  
  7.processing software. - link below.
    (https://processing.org/download/), download as per ur system reqirement
  
  8.Two arduino libraries.(links given respectively)
      1. Minim (http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/)
      2. processing-arduino(http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Processing)
      
      
      Import both the libraries to the Arduino IDE.
  
these were the pre-requisite.Now lets come to the steps.
    
    1.first of all open arduino IDE., then go to file > examples > firmata > standard firmata.
    
    2.upload the code of standard firmata into your arduino board.
    
    3.now make a folder with the name- BeatWrite , i recommend you to make the folder on the desktop.
    
    4.Now copy the two file- 1.BeatWrite.pde, 2.BeatListener to the made folder.
    
    5. Now creat another folder name- data , inside the same folder, the data folder will contain the song which you have to play.
    
    6. now open Beatwriter.pde file in processing.
    
    7.
